Register a preview feature in your Azure subscription to expose more
functionality for a resource provider. Some preview features require approval.

For a preview feature that doesn't require approval, the state is Registered. If
a preview feature requires approval, the registration state is Pending. You must
request approval from the Azure service offering the preview feature. Usually,
you request access through a support ticket. To request approval, submit an
Azure support request. After the registration is approved, the preview feature's
state changes to Registered.
