In November 2011, Google began rolling out a redesign of its interface that
"simplified" the look of Gmail into a more minimalist design to provide a more
consistent look throughout its products and services as part of an overall
Google design change. Majorly redesigned elements included a streamlined
conversation view, configurable density of information, new higher-quality
themes, a resizable navigation bar with always-visible labels and contacts, and
better search.[19][20] Users were able to preview the new interface design for
months prior to the official release, as well as revert to the old interface,
until March 2012, when Google discontinued the ability to revert and completed
the transition to the new design for all users.[21]
